Equinox - a terrible file encryption utility by ag3ntugly

Usage: equinox.py &lt;password&gt; &lt;path_to_file&gt;

Password can be any length, anything you can type, the longer the better.
File can be any old file you have need to obscure from eavesdroppers.
Produces a new file with .eqx appended to the end

The process for decrypting the file is identical to encrypting
just specify the .eqx file, and the origianl file will be unscrambulated.

If the wrong password is supplied, the result will be garbage.

This is neither fast nor efficient and takes a long time for large files.

It is probably also not very secure so you should not trust it with state secrets.
