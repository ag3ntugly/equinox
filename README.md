      Equinox a terrible file encryption utility by ag3ntugly
     Password can be any length, whatever you want, the longer the better.
   Input file can be any old file you have need to obscure from eavesdroppers.
  Output file is a new file with .eqx appended to the name, created in the current
              directory unless an output file name/path is specified.

The process for decrypting the file is identical to encrypting
just specify the .eqx file as the input, and a new file without the .eqx extension
will be created in the current directory, unless an output file name/path is specified

This is slow and iefficient so it takes a long time for large files!

It is probably not very secure so you should not trust it with state secrets.
